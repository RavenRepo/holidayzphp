*(Updated: 2025-05-05T01:33:00+05:30 approx)*

## Current Status
- **UI Component Library**: Implemented foundational UI components with namespaced structure.
- **Layout Components**: Created page-heading and section components for consistent layouts.
- **Form Components**: Added button and input components with variants and styling.
- **Component Registration**: Set up AppServiceProvider for automatic component registration.
- **Welcome Page**: Refactored to use new component system for improved modularity.
- Monorepo structure initialized.
- Root Composer configuration complete.
- Memory Bank structure initialized.
- Frontend Laravel application installed.
- Admin Laravel application installed.
- Ready to configure shared packages and base app setup.
- Initial shared package (`packages/Core`) structure created.
- Ready to implement shared components and link packages via Composer.
- First shared component (`UsesUuid` trait) created.
- Ready to link `holidayz/core` package to `frontend` and `admin` apps.

## What's Working
- Comprehensive UI component library with namespaced components.
- Consistent styling with Tailwind CSS across components.
- Props validation and documentation in components.
- Component categorization (layout, forms, cards, feedback).
- Modular and reusable design patterns.
- Basic monorepo directory structure (`apps`, `packages`, `resources`, `tests`, `memory-bank`).
- Root `.gitignore` file.
- Root `composer.json` configured for PHP 8.2+, PSR-4 autoloading for `Holidayz\Packages`, and path repositories for local `packages`.
- Core Memory Bank documentation files created.
- `apps/frontend` Laravel application installed.
- `apps/admin` Laravel application installed.
- Basic structure for shared `packages/Core` created (`composer.json`, `src/` directory).
- `UsesUuid` trait created in `packages/Core/src/Traits`.

## What's Left to Build
- **Feedback Components**: Implement alerts, modals, and toast notifications.
- **Card Components**: Create reusable cards for packages, blogs, and other content.
- **Interactive Features**: Add Alpine.js for dynamic UI components.
- **Accessibility**: Implement ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation.
- **Component Testing**: Add unit and integration tests for UI components.
- **Documentation**: Create comprehensive component documentation.
- **Additional Components**: Build navigation, tabs, and other UI elements.
- Define and implement shared packages in `packages/` (e.g., CoreModels, Booking, Itinerary).
- Develop frontend UI (Blade views, Tailwind, Alpine).
- Develop admin UI.
- Implement all core features (Package Mgmt, Booking, Blog, Itinerary Builder, Auth, Leads).
- Set up database migrations and models.
- Configure environment variables (`.env`) for each app.
- Implement testing (unit, feature, integration).
- Configure build process (Vite/Mix).
- Prepare deployment strategy for Hostinger.
- **Role Management**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for admin users.

## Known Issues
- None at the moment.
- `edit_file` tool unreliable for modifying `composer.json` in this session (required manual user intervention).
- Password reset and email verification not implemented yet.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Decided to create reusable components for better code organization and maintenance.
- Pushed the initial codebase to GitHub for version control and collaboration.
- Confirmed monorepo root is `d:\Projects files\holidayzphp`.
- Decided to start API routes within `frontend` app.
- Adopted Cline's Memory Bank workflow for documentation and context management.
- Initially planned to use Laravel Breeze for authentication, but switched to custom implementation for better control.
- Separated admin and frontend guards for authentication.
- Using Spatie Permission package for role-based access control (RBAC).
