# Progress: Holidayz Manager (Initial Setup)

*(Updated: 2025-05-05T01:33:00+05:30 approx)*

## What Works

- Basic monorepo directory structure (`apps`, `packages`, `resources`, `tests`, `memory-bank`).
- Root `.gitignore` file.
- Root `composer.json` configured for PHP 8.2+, PSR-4 autoloading for `Holidayz\Packages`, and path repositories for local `packages`.
- Core Memory Bank documentation files created.
- `apps/frontend` Laravel application installed.
- `apps/admin` Laravel application installed.
- Basic structure for shared `packages/Core` created (`composer.json`, `src/` directory).
- `UsesUuid` trait created in `packages/Core/src/Traits`.

## What's Left to Build (High Level)

- Define and implement shared packages in `packages/` (e.g., CoreModels, Booking, Itinerary).
- Develop frontend UI (Blade views, Tailwind, Alpine).
- Develop admin UI.
- Implement all core features (Package Mgmt, Booking, Blog, Itinerary Builder, Auth, Leads).
- Set up database migrations and models.
- Configure environment variables (`.env`) for each app.
- Implement testing (unit, feature, integration).
- Configure build process (Vite/Mix).
- Prepare deployment strategy for Hostinger.

## Current Status

- Monorepo structure initialized.
- Root Composer configuration complete.
- Memory Bank structure initialized.
- Frontend Laravel application installed.
- Admin Laravel application installed.
- Ready to configure shared packages and base app setup.
- Initial shared package (`packages/Core`) structure created.
- Ready to implement shared components and link packages via Composer.
- First shared component (`UsesUuid` trait) created.
- Ready to link `holidayz/core` package to `frontend` and `admin` apps.

## Known Issues

- `edit_file` tool unreliable for modifying `composer.json` in this session (required manual user intervention).

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- Confirmed monorepo root is `d:\Projects files\holidayzphp`.
- Decided to start API routes within `frontend` app.
- Adopted Cline's Memory Bank workflow for documentation and context management.
