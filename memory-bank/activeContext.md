## Recent Issues and Resolutions

### Issue 1: Admin Login Failed
- **Issue**: Admin login failed with SQL error: `Unknown column 'email' in 'where clause'` for the `admins` table.
- **Root cause**: `admins` table was missing `email` and `password` columns, but the admin guard was configured to use this table/model for authentication.
- **Resolution**: Migration for `admins` table updated to include `email` and `password` columns. Ran `php artisan migrate:refresh --seed` to apply the migration and reseed the database.

### Issue 2: Filament Admin Login Not Working
- **Issue**: Filament admin panel login at `http://localhost:8001/admin/` was not working, while custom admin login at `http://localhost:8001/admin/siteadmin/` was working.
- **Root cause**: Filament v3 compatibility issues and missing fields in the Admin model for Filament authentication.
- **Resolution**: 
  - Updated all Filament resources to v3 format
  - Added missing fields to admins table (name, remember_token, email_verified_at)
  - Updated Admin model to implement FilamentUser interface
  - Fixed Dashboard page to be compatible with Filament v3
  - Modified AdminLoginController to redirect to Filament admin panel after login

## Next Steps
- Add feature tests for user registration and role assignment
- Complete documentation of middleware & policy patterns in `systemPatterns.md`
- Add permission cache reset to deployment pipeline
- Implement comprehensive testing for RBAC implementation
- Fix any remaining Filament integration issues
- Add feature tests for role-based access control
- Implement feedback components (alerts, modals, toasts)
- Create card components for packages and blog posts
- Add Alpine.js for interactive components
- Implement accessibility features and component testing
- Continue building out the component library

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Automatically assigning the 'user' role to new registrations
- Using Spatie Permission package for RBAC implementation
- Implementing UUID-based primary keys for security
- Using Filament admin panel for role and permission management
- Categorizing permissions by functionality for better organization
- Using namespaced components (`x-ui.*`) for better organization
- Implementing a consistent props pattern across components
- Following Tailwind CSS best practices for styling
- Ensuring components are accessible and well-documented

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- RBAC implementation with Spatie Permission package
- UUID-based primary keys for security
- Role inheritance hierarchy
- Granular permission system
- Filament admin panel for management interfaces
- Consistent component naming: `x-ui.[category].[name]`
- Props validation and default values in components
- Use of Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Component-first approach to UI development
- Modular and reusable design patterns

## Learnings and Insights
- Proper documentation through memory bank helps maintain project context
- Reusable components improve maintainability and consistency
- Git version control facilitates better collaboration and code management
- Filament v3 requires specific format for resources and pages
- RBAC implementation requires careful planning of roles and permissions
- Categorizing permissions by functionality improves usability
- Integration between custom authentication and Filament requires proper configuration
- UUID-based primary keys provide better security for sensitive data
- Automatic role assignment simplifies user onboarding process
