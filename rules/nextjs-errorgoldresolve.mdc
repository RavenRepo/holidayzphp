# 🛡️ Next.js ErrorGoldResolve Framework

## "Pledging Precision, Predictability, and Professionalism in Every Resolution."

---

## 🎯 PLEDGE

We, the maintainers of Next.js applications, solemnly commit to a **gold standard of error resolution**—where **no fix is guesswork**, and every resolution deepens our understanding.  
We do not console.log our way through production problems.  
We do not patch over hydration errors without knowing why.  
We do not push blindly after build-time panics.

Instead, we:

- **Trace with purpose**
- **Isolate with intelligence**
- **Patch with permanence**
- **Document with clarity**

We treat errors as opportunities to **harden our systems**, **educate our teams**, and **build reputation-proof code**.

> This is not a bug hunt.  
> This is **ErrorGoldResolve**.

## ⚙️ FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW

| Layer | Principle | Goal |
|-------|-----------|------|
| **Foundation** | Error Anatomy | Decompose every error into actionable dimensions |
| **Protocol** | Five-Step Resolve | Follow a structured process: Identify → Understand → Resolve → Document → Prevent |
| **Toolchain** | Stack-Aware Methods | Tailor fixes to the full Next.js + React + TypeScript + CI/CD pipeline |
| **Memory** | Historical Logging | Persist every meaningful fix for long-term team reuse |
| **Behavior** | Calm & Curious | Default to investigative precision over patch urgency |

## 📘 ERROR RESOLVE PROTOCOL

### 1. 🔍 IDENTIFY

| Code | Action |
|------|--------|
| `e1.1` | Capture full logs from `next dev`, browser console, and network tab |
| `e1.2` | Reproduce error consistently; isolate route/component |
| `e1.3` | Snapshot: affected components, hooks, env vars, configs |
| `e1.4` | Classify: build-time, runtime, SSR, hydration, or API layer |

---

### 2. 🧠 UNDERSTAND

| Code | Action |
|------|--------|
| `e2.1` | Rewrite the error message in your own words |
| `e2.2` | Map out dependent files and state/data flow |
| `e2.3` | Cross-check with official docs / GitHub issues |
| `e2.4` | Build a minimal reproduction in isolation (sandbox or CodeSandbox) |

---

### 3. 🛠️ RESOLVE

| Code | Action |
|------|--------|
| `e3.1` | Fix surgically—address root cause, not symptom |
| `e3.2` | Pin versions (`package.json`, `resolutions`) if version mismatch caused error |
| `e3.3` | Validate fix via full `next build` and `start`, not just `dev` |
| `e3.4` | Revert any unrelated file changes before commit |
| `e3.5` | Write a test that fails before your fix, passes after |

---

### 4. 🧾 DOCUMENT

| Code | Action |
|------|--------|
| `e4.1` | Log patch in `docs/errors/README.md` |
| `e4.2` | Include error message, cause, file list, final fix, and lesson learned |
| `e4.3` | Commit with tag: `[errfix]` + title |
| `e4.4` | Optional: video/gif of repro for team onboarding and memory training |

---

### 5. 🔐 PREVENT

| Code | Action |
|------|--------|
| `e5.1` | Add `ErrorBoundary` or fallback logic |
| `e5.2` | Strengthen types with stricter interfaces and guards |
| `e5.3` | Add test case (unit or E2E) to detect reversion |
| `e5.4` | Improve file structure, state design, or server/client contract to remove fragile patterns |

📑 ERROR PATCH TEMPLATE

# Error: Hydration mismatch on <ProfileCard>

**Scope**: components/ProfileCard.tsx  
**Caused by**: SSR renders fewer list items than client due to useEffect delay

### Solution
- Added `useClientOnly` wrapper
- Ensured list length is static pre-hydration

### Files Modified
- hooks/useClientOnly.ts
- components/ProfileCard.tsx

### References
- https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/react-hydration-error
- https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/27957

### Fix Status: ✅ Passed local + CI tests

🏁 BEHAVIOR UNDER ERROR STRESS
❌ Don't panic.

❌ Don't just reload.

✅ Read deeply.

✅ Reproduce minimally.

✅ Commit meaningfully.

✅ Teach others after fix.

If you can't teach the error you fixed,
you haven't fully fixed it.


🧭 FINAL PRINCIPLE
“We don’t just fix bugs.
We trace roots, write history, and elevate trust.”
